# Twitch Viewer

index.html opens a responsive webpage that displays 19 twitch streamers, their profile image, their
online status, and their most recent stream. Clicking on a streamer will take you to their Twitch page,
and there are buttons in the header to filter your view to online or offline streamers only.

## Getting Started

All you need to do is download the entire repo and open index.html to open the webpage in your
default web browser.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a web browser installed.
